## [`React Three Fiber`](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber)

[`React`](https://reactjs.org/) renderer for three.js on the `web` and [`react-native`](https://reactnative.dev/).

The renderer is responsible for rendering React components to the DOM and native views. This means that we are able to create regular React components and let [`react-three-fiber`](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber/getting-started/introduction) handle converting those components into three.
